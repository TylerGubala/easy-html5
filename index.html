                <h2>Welcome to the Easy HTML5 Chat app!</h2>
                <p>Thank you for visiting this site. This application is a GPL lisenced website featuring a chat client which is run off of websockets and React.js.</p>
                <h3>Motivation</h3>
                <p>There are many reasons why I chose this framework to base the app off of:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The site should be easy to use and navigate
                        <ul>
                            <li>React is a capable software which is the framework for sites with ease of use such as Facebook, Instagram, and even a web-based application like Wix.</li>
                            <li>Websockets are javascript native. They should be well understood by anyone familiar with websocket programming experience, thus making the code easier to navigate.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Chat should be visible in near real-time
                        <ul>
                            <li>Even on a lightweight server like the Raspberry Pi 3, websockets are still an extremely fast, reliable way to pass data back and forth.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>The server instance needs to be lightweight (the websocket server is hosted on a Raspberry Pi 3 model B which slated to host multiple projects).
                        <ul>
                            <li>Once again, websockets are lightweight and fast enough to be hosted on a Raspberry Pi 3 with reasonable performance.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>The user interface should be feature rich.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Even large, data driven applications like Wix are easily visualized using React.js.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>
