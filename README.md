Easy HTML5 is a set of applications to solve non-trivial needs met by desktop applications using HTML5 and related browser technologies

The set of applications includes applications for:

Chatting: Easy-Html5-Chat

File Editing: Easy-Html5-File

Drawing: Easy-Html5-Paint

Audio Editing: Easy-Html5-Audio

Video Editing: Easy-Html5-Video

SVG Editing: Easy-Html5-SVG

3d Editing: Easy-Html5-WebGL

While some of these applications may cover topics that are advanced, the primary goal of these applications is to provide as complete of a cross-platform solution for handling common desktop tasks all while making it Easy for the user.

Easy here is defined by:
The full set of features is suported by the application. For instance, in Easy-Html5-Paint, while creating a brush may be non-trivial, the interface for a brush's interaction on the canvas is well defined; a brush modifies pixel values on the canvas and sends an update to the server, who in turn forwards the update to the other users in the same session, thus allowing the application to be multiplayer-like.

If you have any improvements to add to the code, let me know and I can take a look.

Enjoy!
